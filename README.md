## Available Scripts

This was a practice app I forked, to learn about React and creating a temporary backend. It supports CRUD on the back end and the complimentary API operations on the front end. The sample database has information on countries. 

In the project directory, you can run:

###

Starts the JSON server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

The JSON server can be started with `json-server --watch ./src/assets/mock-data/countries.json --port 8000` command too.

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
